If you're having trouble with the automatical installation, you can install the mod manually by following below:

1. Open the folder for the era you are currently playing in. (e.g. "Medieval")
2. Open the main Rimworld config folder that your installed original config files in (AppData\LocalLow\Ludeon Studios\RimWorld by Ludeon Studios\Config).
3. Copy the files from the era specific folder to the main config folder.
4. Overwrite the files in the main config folder if prompted.
5. Start Rimworld.
